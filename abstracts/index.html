<b>Title:</b> The Brauer-Manin obstruction and the order of Brauer classes that capture it.
<br>
<br>
<b>Abstracts:</b>The Brauer-Manin obstruction is a powerful and
mysterious compatibility that local points on a variety must satisfy in
order to approximate a global solution.  In the first lecture, we will
explain how quadratic reciprocity and higher reciprocity laws encode
this compatibility via the Brauer group.  We will provide a flavor of
the different types of Brauer classes and the methods we have for
understanding them, particularly in the case of surfaces.  In the second
lecture, we focus on a finer understanding of the Brauer-Manin
obstruction, namely on the order of elements that capture the
obstruction.  We present results, joint with Brendan Creutz,
characterising these orders in the case of torsors under abelian
varieties, Kummer surfaces, and (conditional on the finiteness of
Tate-Shafarevich groups) bielliptic surfaces.

	<b>Title:</b> Derived Torelli theorems in positive characteristic
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> Broadly speaking, Torelli theorems are concerned
	with the question of when a variety can be recovered from an
	invariant associated to it. The global Torelli theorem, proved in
	the 1970â€™s, shows that K3 and Enriques surfaces over $\mathbb{C}$
	are determined by cohomological data. There is no known equivalent
	statement that holds generally over algebraically closed fields of
	positive characteristic. Progress in this direction has been made
	recently: statements giving Torelli-type theorems in terms of
	derived categories have been proven. In the first of these talks, I
	will introduce the notion of lifting from positive characteristic to
	characteristic 0, which plays a central role in the proofs of these
	theorems.

	<b>Title:</b> Counting curves over an arithmetically interesting field
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> Given two general degree \(d\) complex polynomials
	\(f(x,y)\) and \(g(x,y)\), the equation \(f(x,y) + t g(x,y)\) defines a
	singular curve for exactly \(3(d-1)^2\) complex values of \(t\). This is a
	classical result that has been generalized in many ways to results
	counting complex curves, but the problem of generalizing it by
	replacing the complex numbers with a more arithmetically interesting
	field, such as the rational numbers or a finite field or..., has
	only been taken up recently.  I will describe this recent work,
	especially work of the speaker, Marc Levine, and Kirsten Wickelgren,
	in my talk.
